2. Click on the image
3. Right-click and select "Save image as..."
4. Save it as `logo.png` in the `pharmaguard` folder

**Location:** `C:\Users\Mayank Sagar\OneDrive\Desktop\data\rift2\pharmaguard\logo.png`

## Step 2: The Code is Already Updated!

I've already added the logo code to `pharmaguard_green.html`

The logo will appear:
- ✅ Centered at the top
- ✅ 150px max width
- ✅ Above the "PharmaGuard" title

## Step 3: Refresh Your Browser

1. Save the logo as `logo.png` in the pharmaguard folder
2. Refresh the page (F5)
3. Your logo will appear!

## Alternative: Use a URL Instead

If you want to use an image URL directly (without downloading):

1. Right-click on the Pinterest image
2. Select "Copy image address"
3. Replace `logo.png` with the URL in the HTML

Example:
```html
<img src="https://your-image-url.com/logo.png" alt="PharmaGuard Logo">
```

---

## Customize Logo Size

To change the logo size, edit this line in `pharmaguard_green.html`:

```html
<img src="logo.png" alt="PharmaGuard Logo" style="max-width: 150px;">
```

Change `150px` to:
- `200px` for larger
- `100px` for smaller
- `250px` for much larger
